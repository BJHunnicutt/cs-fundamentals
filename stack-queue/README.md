# Part 1 - Try to write Stack.rb

## Goal
See if you can treat Ruby Arrays like native arrays (don't use Ruby Array methods) to _write an implementation of Stack_

## What to do
In the black box for Stack, implement the [class Stack](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/33-advanced-arrays/lessons/86-stacks-and-queues) with a partner.

# Part 2 - Commenting RubyMonk's Stack.rb and Queue.rb

## Goal
To understand _a_ solution for implementing stacks and queues in Ruby. Note that there are lots of ways to implement data structures, so if you would have done a little/lot different, that's OK.

(Secondary Goal: To learn some new things that you can do in ruby)

## What to do
Comment the code to explain what's happening.

# Job Simulation Assignment

## Goal
To _utilize_ stacks and queues in solving a programming problem.

## Description
A company has six hiring positions with more people wanting jobs than the number of available positions.  The company managers decide in order to give more people an opportunity to make money; they will allow people to work in three-month intervals. The first five people on the waiting list will be hired in the order that they are on the waiting list.  The first six people will keep these positions for three months.  At the end of three months, the manager will roll a dice to determine the number of people who will lose their jobs. The company will use the policy of last-hired-first-fired.  For example, if the dice roll is 3, the last 3 people hired will lose their jobs to the first 3 people on the waiting list. People losing their jobs will be placed on the back of the waiting list in the order that they are fired. This process will continue for every three-month interval.

## What to do
Write job-simulation.rb to do the above
